### Project Lifecycle:

**Initiate the Project**
- define project goals
- determine resources, people, and other project details
- get approval from management

**Make a Plan**
- create a budget
- set the schedule
- establish your team, determine roles and responsibilities
- plan for risk *and* change

**Execute and Complete Tasks**
- manage progress
- communicate (err on the side of over-communication)
- make adjustments

**Close Project**
- check to make sure all tasks have been completed
- confirm acceptance of the project outcome
- reflect on lessons learned (retrospective)
- share final results with stakeholders (including all documentation)
- celebrate!
- formally move on from the project.

### Project Management Methodology

1. Linear! One step at a time. Final result is unlikely to change.
2. Iterative - different tasks can be in progress simultaneously, end result can change throughout. Allows for flexibility and expects changes

**Waterfall**
This is linear, and is used from construction to product and app design. There are many styles as well.
The process for waterfall mirrors that of a project lifecycle.
It is utilized when the phases of the project are clearly defined and most tasks must be completed before moving on to the next one. *Also when making changes expensive.* There are still ways to manage risk though.
- changes go through a formal request process

**Agile**
This is iterative, and movies quickly, with changes made frequently and easily. Usually phases overlap and tasks are completed in iterations.
Good for when the result is not clearly defined, but the customer has a list of qualities or some idea of what they want it to look like.
Also good for when uncertainty and risk are high.
- progress towards milestone is dependent on stakeholder feedback

**Lean Six Sigma**
This is a fusion of Lean and Six Sigma, which is utilized when the goals are to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. Also focuses on team collaboration. 

The five phases for this are:
**D**efine - tells you what to measure
**M**easure - tells you what to analyze
**A**nalyze - tells you what to improve
**I**mprove - tells you what to control
**C**ontrol - monitoring the project and ensuring quality

DMAIC be applied to any business problem! 

**Lean** helps limit resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to maximize benefits. The 5S quality tool:
- Sort: remove unneeded items
- Set in order - arrange and label items so they are easy to use
- Shine - keep the workspace clean and items in their proper place
- Standardize - perform the process the same way each time
- Sustain - make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team

It also uses a Kaban board to help monitor progress, which categorizes tasks into To Do, In Progress, Testing, and Done.

**Six Sigma** reduces variations by ensuring quality procedures are followed every time.
- Focus on the customer
- Identify and understand the work itself, and how it gets done
- Make your processes flow smoothly
- Reduce waste and concentrate on value
- Stop defects by removing variation
- Involve and collaborate with your team
- Approach improvement and activity in a systematic way.

For some reason there are seven principles. The seem kind of abstract and arbitrarily arranged.

**Scrum** is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products with small cross-functional teams lead by a Scrum Master. Short deliverables

Differentiating qualities between LeanSixSigma and Scrum seems difficult.
LSS is more long term, Scrum is shorter development sprints for iterative design
