What is a "project"?
	It's a unique endeavor, with unique deliverables.
	It's temporary, with a beginning and an end.
it involves planning, organizing, budgeting, and communicating.
It's a project manager's job to make sure the project is both valuable and successful.

Manufacturing, construction, IT, publishing, finance, oil and gas are all industries that are experiencing growth in project manager positions.
