### Organizational Structure


Organizational structure helps you understand where you fit in, who to communicate with, and how frequently.

Commonly mapped out using an org chart, showing the relationships of people and groups within the organization, and who reports to who.

Classic Structure is a typical top-down system of reporting, like a chain of command.
Matrix Structure has people directly above you, but also people laterally from other departments/programs that need your reports for their work.

Looks to me like siloed columns vs a table with columns and rows.

Project Management Office (PMO):
	A group within an organization that sets and defines project management standards and processes in the organization. It often acts as a coordinated center for all of the organization's projects. They offer guidance and support to the project managers.
	Functions:
	- Strategic planning and governance
	- Best practices
	- Common project culture
	- Resource management
	- Creation of project documentation archives, and tools

A PMO's basic functions are:
- Strategic planning and governance
	- The most important one; this involves defining project criteria, selecting projects according to the org's business goals, and then providing a business case for those projects to the management team.
- Best Practices
	- process guidance, lessons previously learned, 
- Common project culture
	- setting the culture for new employees to work effectively in the organization
- Resource management
	- providing training, mentoring, coaching to all employees, especially PMs, and helping define roles and responsibilities while allocating resources
- Creation of project documentation, archives, and tools
	- providing templates, tools, and software to manage projects and maintain the org's project history

### Organizational Culture

A company's culture is really important! Asking about the company's culture at an interview is a great way to get more info about the company and shows you understand how big of an impact it can have on a project.

Ask questions. What's going well? What do your peers think should change? Make observations, like what people like and respect about the company's culture. Understand your impact.

**The Importance of organizational culture**

Identity
	describes the way the company does business, hand in hand with the company's values. You can think of this as a company's personality, giving insight into what the company believes and how it will behave.

People
	Culture can help retain a company's best employees, while attracting great people too. People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to perform better and drive for success.

Processes
	A company's culture almost always reflects on the way it works, internally and externally, and in turn the way the company does business inside and outside affects the culture. If a company values feedback, opportunities for clients and employees to comment will be incorporated into the process.

==As a project manager, understanding the company's culture helps navigate departmental interactions and communicate more effectively.==

"What are the top 3 challenges you want to solve today?"

==Help your team determine what success looks like for each week.==

### Understanding Change Management

You completed your project. Yay! Now what?
Having others adopt it is the first step to it having an effect on the org's processes. This is change management!

**Core Concepts:
- creating a sense of *ownership* and *urgency* (getting others to feel like they are empowered to take responsibility for the successful completion of their tasks, and that the project is important and what is required for progress)
- Finding the right combination of skills and personalities
- Effective communication. This is key!

Some good practices:
- be proactive
- communicate about upcoming changes
- follow a consistent process
- practice empathy
- use tools like feedback mechanisms, flowcharts, and culture maps

Governance in business is the framework within which decisions are made and accountability and responsibility are determined.

### How to uncover job opportunities!

**Analyze job listings**: collect a number of job descriptions and rank the frequency of each requirement.

**Create a professional inventory**: a comprehensive list of technical skills, interpersonal skills, personal qualities, and education.

**Match your profile to the job requirements**
