Complex ways to track budgets! Myriad of approvals! Legal teams! Lots of acronyms! There's a lot in this module.

### Understanding budgets

Budgets are broken down by milestones. A Forecast is a cost estimate for a period of time.

The budget is actually created during the *initiation phase* of the project, but is generally adjusted as needed throughout the lifecycle of the project. The budgeting process itself usually happens in conjunction with the scheduling process.

Most companies have a signing or spending policy, which outlines who is authorized to commit resources or incur costs on behalf of the company. After the project manager collaborates with the team to get estimations for the budget, the sponsor or another shareholder typically review and approve the estimated costs.

When creating a budget, the project manager must account for
- Understanding stakeholder needs
- Budgeting for surprise expenses (contingency budget)
- Maintaining adaptability
- Reviewing and reforecasting throughout the project

To put together a budget estimate, you must calculate
- Resource cost rates
- Reserve analysis
	a method to check for remaining project resources
- Contingency budget
	a budget for potential risks
- Cost of quality
	Costs that are incurred to prevent issues with product, processes, and tasks. This includes
	- Prevention costs
	- Appraisal costs
	- Internal failure costs
	- External failure costs

Budget planning best practices:
- Reference historical data - research how budgets for similar projects went.
- Utilize your team, mentors, or manager - get into the habit of asking your team to doublecheck your work, particularly for areas where they have expertise
- Time-phase your budget - track and compare planned vs. actual costs over certain timespans and manage changes to the budget as necessary
- Check and double-check for consistency and clarity - other departments will be approving and using your budget, so making sure it is error-free and easy to follow is important

*Direct costs* are for specific items necessary to complete the project. They include:
- Wages
- Materials
- Equipment rental
- Software licensing
- Project-related transportation
- Staff training

*Indirect costs* are for items that do not directly lead directly to the completion of the project but are essential for the ream to do their work. These include:
 - Administrative costs
 - Utilities
 - Insurance
 - General office equipment
 - Security

### Managing a project budget

Steps for creating a budget:
1. Get historical data
	Find out what past project managers did right and wrong
2. Leveraging experts
	Getting advice and input from experts in the field, or anyone who has experience in what you are doing
3. Bottom up approach
	Laying out all the parts of the project from start to finish and listing everything you will need
4. Confirm accuracy
	Consult with your team about estimates and double-check everything
5. Baseline
	Using all this, set a dollar amount as a baseline for each section of the project to track progress and success. Adjustments almost always will need to be made!

Make sure to factor in fixed costs, buffers and reserves. This is standard practice. Setting planned cost vs. actual cost helps you monitor the cost every step of the way and avoid exhausting your reserves.

Monitoring the budget is crucial for a project manager to enforce accountability in terms of spending. **Milestones** are a great opportunity to review the budget again and identify anything that needs to be reset or revisited throughout the project.

Cost control is proactive budget management, where the project manager identifies factors that might impact the budget and then creates effective actions to minimize variances from the baseline.

To control costs,
- Establish a sign off plan and inform appropriate stakeholders of any changes that occur
- Manage changes as they're made
- Accept that budget misses will happen, and determine with sponsors and stakeholders what the acceptable limit is for overage

Going under budget is a problem too! It's an indicator of less than satisfactory budget management, and that more money could have been spent on extra resources or better quality output. It may adversely affect the budget of future projects as well.

CAPEX - capital expenses, long term, benefits the company's future
OPEX - operational expenses, short term and often recurring

While contingency reserves cover potential risks, they are risks that are foreseen. Management reserves are for covering *unidentified risks*.
Contingency reserves are usually an estimated amount, while management reserves are usually a percentage of the total budget.

Fixed contracts usually pay out when milestones are reached. Time & materials contracts are a regular payment schedule.

### Introduction to procurement

Vendors are typically used for specialized skills which aren't available within your company. Vendor management entails:
- Sourcing vendors
- Getting quotes for vendor's work
- Deciphering which ones will fulfill your needs
- Negotiating vendor contracts
- Setting deadlines for vendors
- Evaluating performance
- Ensuring vendors are paid

The procurement process:
- Initiating - defining what help you need outside of your current resources
- Selecting - determining what supplies you need and which vendors to use
- Contract writing - from contract development, review, and getting signed
- Control - maintaining quality and ensuring service agreement is being met
- Completing - measuring the success of the procurement

Procurement can differ depending on the methodology.
Traditional procurement management:
- Focus on standard contracts with clear terms and deliverables
- Project manager may be responsible for end-to-end procurement
- Contracts may feature lengthy and extensive documentation

Agile procurement management:
- Collaborative with both project team and end supplier
- Emphasis on the relationship between parties
- Project team plays a larger role in identifying procurement needs
- Living contract

Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)
	 I know this one already.

Request for proposal (RFP)
	A document outlining the details of a project for the vendor, so that they can get back to you with a proposal on how they will handle the job
		Make sure it has headers for overview, goals, scope of work, milestones,  submission requirements, and questions you want the vendor to answer

NDA and RFP are fixed and do not change throughout the project. Statement of Work (SoW) changes as the project goes on.

Statement of work is usually created by the project manager, but they consult subject matter experts (SME). Legal advisors will review the document as well, and in some cases take part in crafting it alongside the project manager.
	In addition to relevant project details like deliverables and scope, this document also contains a history of revisions.

### Navigating procurement challenges

As the project manager, you will be responsible for making sure procurement is ethical and abides by state and county business laws. Consult with others- if something feels wrong, it's probably a sign. Check with your company's legal experts!

Common ethical traps:
- Corruption and bribery: self-explanatory
- Sole-supplier sourcing: anti-competitive
- Interactions with state-owned agencies: they often have much stricter regulations

To avoid these...
- Understand the legal requirements of your procurements
- Stick to your ethical codes
- Test your ethics.
	- Shame: Would you be ashamed if someone knew what you did?
	- Community: Would you want your friends to know about the decision you made?
	- Legal: Would you face legal action if you did this?
	- Situation: Would your actions be justified in this situation?
	- Consequence: Would a negative outcome be worth your action?
