This module covers:
- Kicking off the planning phase
- Setting and reaching milestones and identifying tasks to do so
- Budgeting process
- Identifying and planning for risks
- Documentation

Review: Project Initiation
	Project manager is assigned,
	Project goals, scope, and deliverables must be approved
	Team members get assigned
	Get signoff on your project charter

## Understanding the planning phase

Planning helps...
- Understand the work needed to achieve your goal
- Coordinate efforts and timelines with other teams, contractors, and vendors
- Identify and prepare for risks
- Get buy-in from key members of the project team

The three main parts of the planning phase are the **schedule, budget, and risk management.**

The project kickoff meeting should include the team members, stakeholders, and sponsor. This will help you team by
- establishing a shared vision
- aligning on scope
- building team rapport
- giving them the opportunity to ask questions and offer insights
- setting expectations

These meetings are typically structured like this:
- Introduction of people and their roles
- Background on the project (how it came about, why it matters)
- Goals and scope
- Explaining the individual roles
- Collaboration (what tools used and expectations there will be)
- What comes next- setting expectations
- Questions and feedback! Gain clarity and make sure the project is benefiting from diversity of thoughts and experiences.

Don't ambush your team members- send them an agenda for the meeting a day or two ahead of time. And make sure to ask someone to take notes!

==The quiz says the planning phase "helps team members become a strong team by working together." I thought this was wrong because there is little or no work for them to do in the planning phase, but it seems they meant that planning helps clarify a mutual understanding of the project and establish rapport. That could have been worded differently to be less confusing.


## Defining tasks and milestones

Milestones are reached by completing certain tasks. (much wow)

Setting milestones is important! It helps by
- giving you a clear understanding of the amount of work required. Manageable chunks
- keeping your project on track with clear deadlines
- uncovering areas where you may need to adjust scope, timelines or resources
- motivating your team as you make progress. This one's extra important!
- ==also showing progress to your stakeholders==
Milestones *must* be completed sequentially and on time! Because they're sequential, missed deadlines will cause delays and expand the timeline and or budget.

Refer back to your project charter, and think about what your team needs to do to achieve the goal. The big items that indicate progress are your milestones. Smaller items that your stakeholders wouldn't want to review are tasks.

**Top-down scheduling**: first outlining milestones and then defining the tasks that will be required to reach them

**Bottom-up scheduling**: looking at all the individual tasks required to reach the goal and grouping them into manageable chunks as milestones

Don't set too many milestones- the number needed will depend on the project.
Don't mistake tasks for milestones; milestones represent moments in time, like mini-goals.
Don't list tasks and milestones separately. They are interdependent and should be visualized together.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
	a tool that sorts the milestones and tasks in a hierarchy of importance by the order in which they need to be completed
(note: not typically included in the official project plan)

Creating a Work Breakdown Structure:
- Define scope and objectives
- Break down into key phases and deliverables
- Organize deliverables into work packages (defining the work, duration, and cost for tasks, as well as owners)

**Asana** is very good for assigning tasks. Assigning tasks helps create a sense of personal responsibility and ownership for the team. This helps keep them motivated and invested! (Also helps build trust and rapport)

#### Starting the Planning phase
1. Gantt chart? Sounds like a schedule. Helps outline and clarify task timelines and dependencies.
2. Estimate the budget, and include a buffer for overages. They are always overages.
3. Create a Statement of Work (SoW) for any vendors and yourself
	 a legal document that defines what you need from the vendor and sets clear expectations.
4. Create a risk management plan, anticipating sick days, staffing shortages, shipping delays, etc.
5. Create a communication plan to track senders and recipients, communication goals, key dates, and more. It's important for information to travel timely and smoothly, so plan this beforehand!
