Communication is a two-way street, and needs to happen throughout the entire lifecycle of the project (fairly obvious).

Effective communication is *clear, honest, relevant, and frequent.* But not too frequent. Some tips for being more effective:
- **Recognize and understand individual differences**: be mindful and don't make assumptions!
- **Brainstorm and craft the appropriate message**: Consider who your audience is, what they should know and what you need (or don't need) from them. The focus is clarity.
- **Deliver your message**: Decide which method is most appropriate, and avoid including any sensitive or private information. Assume everyone at the company will receive the communication.
- **Obtain feedback and incorporate it**: Check to make sure the message was clear and ask for feedback. Respond to questions timely and encourage open communication.

Because there will be so much communication for any project you do, you will need a **communication plan** that organizes and documents the process, methods, and expectations of communication for the project.

The communication plan needs to address the what, who, when, why, and how of communication, and where it will be recorded and stored.
It kind of seems like a lot for just *communication*, but planning this out helps make it easier to keep people engaged and motivated, gets stakeholders more involved in effective conversations, and improves the communication overall.

Continuity refers to planning for the project to be able to carry on in your absence, should it happen. Also a good reason to document everything.

Check in with your team and evaluate where you may be over- or under-sharing information.

Only share info on a need-to-know basis. Some info will be sensitive, and it's up to you to manage who sees what.

It's good to be comprehensive, but avoid death by a thousand documents!
