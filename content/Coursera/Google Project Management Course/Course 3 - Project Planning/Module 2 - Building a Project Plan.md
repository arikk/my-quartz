### Getting started with a project plan

Most project plans are made up of five elements:
- Tasks
- Milestones
- People
- Documentation
- Time

Scope and goals - Work Breakdown Structure - Management plans - Budget
These are connected!

### Using estimation to set project timelines

(Management plans are plans on how to handle communication, risk, and any changes that will arise, anything that helps keep the project on track.)

Effort vs. time estimation: Painting a wall takes 3 hours of work (effort) and 24 hours to dry (time)
This is useful for planning multitasking/parallel tasks.

Your teammates will have the most realistic estimates of how long their tasks will take. Who knew!

Time buffers are nice, but should be used sparingly for tasks within the teams control. It may be easier to set a project buffer at the end of the project instead of many smaller task buffers along the way.

Don't get caught up in the optimism fallacy; Murphy's Law may be a bit extreme, but something is guaranteed to go differently than your plan. Expect the unexpected.

Capacity planning refers to the allocation of people's time and energy, and other resources to project tasks.
(Earlier people counted as resources, but the mini quiz separates them two different things)

Capacity planning involves these areas of focus:
- Identifying parallel tasks vs. sequential tasks and maximizing your team's use of time. Sequential tasks help you see what you need to prioritize.
- Determine which tasks have a fixed start date
- Determine earliest start dates for all other tasks
- Identify if a task has **float** (or slack)
		The amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule and threatens the outcome
	Tasks on the critical path will have no float.

Deciding how a teammate should prioritize their time and make the most of their capacity can be done by determining the **critical path**:
	A list of project milestones and their mandatory tasks required to meet the project goal on schedule. It is the *bare minimum* number of tasks and milestones needed to reach your goal.

To determine the your critical path,
1. Capture all tasks
2. Set dependencies
3. Create a **network diagram**, sequencing tasks based on dependencies and parallels. Non-essential tasks are not part of the critical path.
4. Make time estimates for essential and non-essential tasks using capacity planning. Essential tasks will have zero float, while non-essential ones will have some float.
The essential tasks and their required time will be your critical path!

You can also calculate the critical path two ways:
1) Forward pass - adding the duration of each task on the critical path from start to finish. Good for simplicity. Potential for expansion?
2) Backwards pass - start at the end goal and work backwards through the required tasks. Helps with hard deadlines by focusing on which tasks are really critical. Some tasks may be completed later or cut altogether.

Soft skills are personal characteristics that help you work effectively with others. They will be helpful for gathering accurate estimates from your teammates.
Some common ones to apply:
- Asking the right questions - open ended and follow ups!
- Negotiating effectively - ask probing questions and follow ups to get a feel for their flexibility and workload
- Practicing empathy - ask about their workload, inside and outside the project, as well as any other things that may demand their time and focus, including rest and time off.

Angel sounds like a great project manager :)

### Utilizing tools to build a project plan

The anchor of a clear project plan is a clear schedule, containing all tasks, their owners, and their deadlines.

**Gantt chart** - a horizontal bar chart that maps a project schedule.
	Common left columns: task title, task owner, start date, due date, duration, % completed. The rows below will list each task. Great place to plug in your work breakdown structure.
	Right columns will be for days and weeks estimated to complete the project from start to finish. The rows below this will show bars/markers showing dates when each task will take place.

May not work for all projects!

**Kanban board** - uses cards to track and visualize the progress of your tasks, typically moving tasks between columns like "to do," "in progress," "testing," and "done." This tool is useful for an Agile project approach. 
		refresher - Agile is an iterative development process where results are tested along the way, incorporating customer feedback.
	Kanban boards help by
	- giving a quick visual understanding of work details and critical task info
	- facilitating hand-offs between stakeholders and team members
	- capturing metrics and improving workflows
	Cards have:
	- titles/ID numbers for one task
	- who is assigned to the task
	- description of work
	- estimation of effort
	- start date, finish date
	- blocked days where it cannot be worked on

Asana and Trello both have good Kanban plugins.

Or you could just have a large document containing tables, lists, and links to other planning documents. It's up to you to decide how to keep everyone on the same page as long as you include all of the critical project elements in one place.
	Task names (or ID numbers if there are a lot) to make communication clear
	Task durations to get clear time estimates and schedule
	Start and finish dates on tasks to measure progress
	Who is responsible for each task

==Best practices for project planning:==
- Carefully review deliverables, milestones, and tasks
- Give yourself time to plan
- Recognize and plan for the inevitable; things will go wrong, but it's okay!
- Stay curious - ask your teammates lots of questions about their work
- Champion your plan
	Can your teammates use the tool you used to build the plan?
	Is the information clear enough for your stakeholders?
	Will using this plan as a singular source of truth save your team and stakeholders time and energy when they need to find information on the project?
	If the answer to each of these is "yes," then stand by your plan and advocate for its benefits.
