Flexibility is an important skill for managing projects!

### Understanding risk management

A **risk** is a potential event. If it actually manifests, it becomes an **issue**.
Risk management is the process of identifying and evaluating risks and issues in a project, and handling them accordingly.

In addition to telling you what could go wrong, risk management also includes who you'll need to consult with and how the risk could be mitigated. Doing so helps you find ways to change course and alter your project plan so that you can complete it even when issues arise, expected or unexpected.

Identify the risk, analyze it, evaluate, treat it, then monitor and control.

A secondary part of risk management is recognizing and seizing **opportunities**. Cancelations can mean extra time or other resources become available. Use the same process for managing risk to plan for and make the best use of opportunities. 
Sometimes these opportunities are referred to as positive risks.

### Identifying and assessing risks

Bring your team together to brainstorm risks (reference the RACI chart for participants).
(It should go without saying, but make sure that brainstorming is a judgement free zone.)

You can also structure it with a cause-and-effect diagram, or fishbone diagram/Ishikawa diagram. Consider a risk, or an effect, and work backwards to determine potential causes of that risk.

Risk assessment generally focuses on determining the likelihood of the risk and its potential effects on the project. Prioritize risks with a **probability-impact matrix**, where you measure probability against impact on a grid. This is a way of measuring [[|risk exposure]].

Budget risk
	Risk of the budget increasing, either through poor planning or increase in scope

Scope risk
	The possibility that the project won't produce the results outline in the project goal

External risk
	Risks from factors outside the company that you have little or no control over

There are endless more kinds of risks, and there will never be a prescription for all possible risks. But it's okay- planning ahead helps you be better prepared!

Singe point of failure
	A risk that has the potential to be catastrophic and halt work across a project

Dependencies are also large sources of risks, since tasks depend on others before they can be started or completed.

Dependencies come in all variations of start-to-finish. In addition to planning out the schedule, dependency graphs are also helpful in identifying risk.

### Mitigating and communicating risks

The four types of risk mitigation are:
- *Avoid* the risk altogether by going with a different option
- *Minimize* the effects or likelihood of the risk
- *Transfer* the risk to another party or entity (like outside the tea,/company)
- *Accept* - this usually means setting aside extra funds just in case.

In your risk management plan, you will include a section detailing the risks and their mitigation plans. The probability and impact matrix will be located at the bottom of the document in the appendix.

Failing to communicate risks to stakeholders can erode the trust in you as the leader of the project. The severity of the risk will dictate how you go about sharing and discussing them.
