## Module 1: Project Initiation

It's the first step, so it's important that you set yourself up for success!

**Recap**: It's a project managers responsibility to identify the project's goals, resources, and other details, based on discussion with the project stakeholders.

Initiation is an opportunity to gain clarity on expectations, which will save a lot of time for everyone throughout the project.

Considerations for Cost Benefit Analysis:
- value created
- reduced costs
- increased profit
- time saved
- improved user experienced
Balance these with...
- time investment
- one-time costs
- ongoing costs
- long-term costs

Also considerable are intangible benefits!
- customer satisfaction
- employee satisfaction
- employee productivity
- brand perception
...As well as intangible costs, like employee retention, or any of the above benefits.

==I'm very glad these are mentioned. Sometimes the intangible is difficult to describe, but can be very important.==

Key components of project initiation:
- Goals - what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve
- Scope - defining the work that needs to get done to complete the project
- Deliverables - products and services that you will create for the client
- Success Criteria - the standards by which you measure how successful a project was
- Stakeholders - the people who have an interest in and are affected by the completion and success of the project
- Resources - budget, people, and materials you have at your disposal
==Interesting that they ordered these this way, with resources on the bottom...==

A **project charter** is a framework for you to organize and clarify all these details and communicate them to others.

It's important to build you "listening to learn" muscle.

(G-C) / C = ROI
ROI is interesting. At first it seems strange, but then it makes sense.

## Module 2 - Identifying project goals

RACI chart?

SMART goals:
	Specific
		What do I want to accomplish? Why is this a goal? Who is involved? Where should it be delivered? To what degree?
	Measurable
		How much/how many? How can you know it is accomplished?
	Attainable
		Can it be reasonably reached? How can it be accomplished?
	Relevant
		Does this goal make sense? Is it worthwhile? Is it the right time?
	Time-bound
		Has a deadline or a clear timeframe

Objectives and Key Results: combining a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome.

Company level OKRs are shared across an organization so that everyone can align and focus to help the company reach its goals.
Project level OKRs help define measurable project goals, and need to align with both company and department level OKRs.

Project Scope: the boundaries of a project
Scope-defining questions should be posed in these contexts:
- Stakeholders
- Goals
- Deliverables
- Resources
- Budget
- Schedule
- Flexibility
Make sure to define *who, what, when, why,* and *how.*

**Out-of-scope**: tasks that are not included in the project plan and don't contribute to the goal

**Scope-creep**: changes/growth/uncontrolled factors that affect a project's scope at any point after the project begins

To help avoid scope-creep,
- make project plans visible
- get clarity on project requirements
- set ground rules and expectations for stakeholder involvement
- create a plan for dealing with out-of-scope requests
- put your agreements and plans in writing

==Important:==
Any change outside of a project scope comes off the bottom line, and it is your job as a project manager to maintain the boundaries of the project. The best defense is to know all of the project's ins and outs.

Best practices to help control scope creep:
- Define project requirements
- Set a clear project schedule
- Determine what is out of scope
- Provide alternatives
- Set up a change control process
- Learn how to say no
- Collect costs of out-of-scope work
==These points are very sequential!==

There is a balance between scope, time, and costs, in the shape of a triangle. Kind of like balancing time, cost, and quality. Or like geometry! Changing one area will have a direct effect on one or more of the others. There is always a tradeoff.

Document everything beforehand and make sure everyone (team *and* stakeholders) is in agreement on the scope before the start of the project.

Launching and Landing
	properly delivering the project and tracking the results after the product has been in use

Don't launch and forget! It is relieving to hand your project over to the client and celebrate completion, but ensuring the project's *success* means you need to see if it meets the success criteria you laid out beforehand, or is on track to meet them.

==Baking a cake isn't enough to tell whether you did a good job- someone has to taste it and confirm.==

To determine a project's success criteria...
- Identify measurable aspects of your project
- Get clarity from stakeholders on project requirements and expectations (key!)
Document and share all the info so that the team and stakeholders can refer to it later.

The metric(s) you choose must be as closely aligned to the project goal as possible. Satisfaction, adoption, and engagement are some ways of measuring success. 

==It's smart to measure success while the project/product is in progress.== This can be done by having your team complete checklists for progress meetings, or hold live feedback sessions with users/customers.

Methods for measuring criteria for success should include how, when (how often), and who. **Defining success criteria should create greater alignment in the team and give everyone better visibility of how to achieve success.** Remember SMART goals!
