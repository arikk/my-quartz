There are lots of ways to collect data today! Utilizing it can prevent both major and minor issues, as well as reach goals and success metrics.

Specifically, using data you can
- make better decisions, informed and supported by facts
- solve problems
- understand performance
- improve processes
- understand your users

### Metrics

Productivity metrics:
- Milestones
- Tasks
- Projections
- Duration

Quality metrics:
- Number of changes
- Issues
- Cost variance

There are also happiness metrics, adoption metrics, engagement metrics... 
But which ones you will focus on will depend on your goals and feedback from stakeholders.

### Data ethics

Since data informs any major decisions made for a project, and these decisions can have wide-reaching and direct effects on people, companies abide by a set of ethics surrounding data.
Businesses apply data ethics so that they can...
- Comply with regulations
- Show that they are trustworthy
- Ensure fair and reasonable data usage
- Minimize bias
- Develop a positive public perception

Two examples of principles that data ethics are rooted in are **data privacy** and **data bias**.

Data privacy
	This includes things like presenting the purpose of data collection and processing, privacy preferences of individuals, the way personal information is handled and shared, and the rights individuals have over their own data. Some ways to practice this are increasing awareness of data privacy in your company, using approved security tools, and anonymizing data for it to be freely shared.

Data bias
	This refers mainly to the collection of data and making sure the method of collection does not introduce errors or false representations. This includes common biases found in other fields like sampling bias, observer bias, interpretation bias, and confirmation bias.

### Analysis

After finding out what data you need and collecting it, you still need to know how to process and interpret it!

Data analysis has six key steps:
1. Ask
	Asking the right questions is important, especially making sure you are focusing on the core problem and not one of its symptoms. This also includes finding out what your stakeholders' goals are.
2. Prepare
	This is collecting and storing the data you need.
3. Process
	Cleaning the data, which involves things like arranging, categorizing, checking for duplicates, biased or invalid responses, as well as typos or other errors.
4. Analyze
	Breaking the data down to draw conclusions from it. This is often emphasized with a chart, graph, or some other way of visualizing the data to illustrate your point.
5. Share
	This is presenting your findings to your team, stakeholders, and sponsors. The graphs come in handy here!
6. Act
	The business/company takes action and implements changes based on the data you have gathered and analyzed.

### Presentation

Stories are a major part of the human experience- they are how we form the framework for our understanding of the world. Project managers use data to tell stories, and in order to be effective, those stories must be complete, accurate, and compelling.

Six steps to storytelling:
1. Define your audience
2. Collect the data
3. Filter and analyze the data
4. Choose a visual representation
5. Shape the story
6. Gather your feedback

Visualization tools help
- filter your information by focusing the audience on the most important data points and insights
- condense long ideas and facts into a single image or representation
- make sense of the information being presented

You can use bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, and more, but keep them simple! Don't overload them with too much text or too many different elements. (Should be understandable in about 5 seconds)
Some other key points to keep in mind are
- Identify the problem you are solving for your audience, and remove content that dilutes your narrative
- Consider the time you have and your approach if you might have to shorten the presentation
- Identify potential questions and objections, and come up with answers ahead of time
- Be memorable! Also pay attention to body language.

It's important to review your presentation for accessibility as well.
- Create clear, simple slides
- Add alt text for images, drawings, and graphics
- Use text for critical information
- Provide captions if you have audio or video recordings
- For contrast and text size, more is better (ideal contrast ratio is 7:1) (also avoid using all caps)
- Share contents in advance, or at least an outline. Glossary might help too!
