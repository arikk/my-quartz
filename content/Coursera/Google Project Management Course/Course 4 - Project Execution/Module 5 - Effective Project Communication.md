Throughout projects, as the project manager you will need to communicate certain information multiple times and in various ways. Different people learn in different ways. That's just how it is!

Reinforce important information multiple times in multiple different ways to make sure everyone is in the loop.

Tips for email writing:
- State what you want clearly.
	- Include request in the subject line
	- State request within first two paragraphs
	- Indicate a specific call-to-action in your request
	- Write clear concise sentences when providing details
	- Define terms and avoid acronyms or terminology that users may not know.
- Keep the content short and concise.
	- Summarize the content you want to convey
	- Aim for your email to be "questionless" and "self-standing"
	- Know your audience, and tailor accordingly
- Structure your writing.
	- Use bullets, labels, etc.
	- Add hyperlinks
	- Write strong topic sentences (place the main idea of the paragraph in its first sentence)
- Check grammar, punctuation, and spelling.

We all get lots of emails a day, so here are some best practices:
- Carefully select who you're sending emails to and why
- Make sure the subject field clearly previews what the email is about
- Keep messages as short as possible and stay on topic
- Attach or link large amounts of information separately
- Clearly state action items
- Use correct grammar, spelling, and clear/common terminology only
- Write in an appropriate tone

Instant messaging apps might be more appropriate for quick, short, or urgent communication. But it's always best to determine the best way to communicate on an individual basis!

Effective meetings are
- Structured
	- Start and end on time
	- Carefully selected attendees
	- Prioritized topics
	- Designated notetakers
- Intentional
	- Clearly stated purpose and expectations (in meeting agenda and subject line)
	- Everyone understands why they're meeting
- Collaborative
	- Make it clear that attendee's input is valued and needed
	- Allow for people to respond to the meeting in their preferred method
- Inclusive
	- Help participants feel comfortable sharing different perspectives
	- Do things like appoint a moderator to handle attendee questions
	- Leave space in the meeting for participants who have been quiet
	- Accommodate for disabilities or impairments

Google's study shows that productive meetings have three things in common:
1. Active participation from attendees
2. A clear and concise agenda that is followed through
3. The correct attendees, meaning the participants can contribute to achieving the meeting's goal

There are generally four types of meetings:
1. Project kick-offs
2. Status updates
3. Stakeholder reviews
4. Project reviews
