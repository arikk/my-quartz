You don't want to stop at just calling a project done- the quality has to be there too.

For quality management, there are four main concepts:
- Quality standards
- Quality planning
- Quality assurance
- Quality control
**Quality standards**
	Clearly defined requirements, specifications, or guidelines that are used to ensure that whatever you do or make has the desired outcome
Doing this correctly will result in less rework and schedule delays.

Some examples are:
- Reliability standards - expectations of team members or partners to be on time and well prepared for their responsibilities
- Usability standards - making sure the product fits the circumstances and needs of the client/user
- Product standards - making sure that the product itself is made and operates to specifications

**Quality planning**
	Establishing a process for identifying and defining exactly which standards of quality are relevant to the project (and how to satisfy them)
		What outcome does the customer want?
		What does quality look like for them?
		How can I meet their expectations?
		How will I determine if the quality measures will lead to success?

**Quality assurance (QA)**
	Evaluating if your project is moving towards delivering a high-quality service or product
Unlike the previous two, this spans the whole project lifecycle. The focus of this is to prevent defects before they occur.

**Quality control (QC)**
	Monitoring project results to determine if they are meeting desired outcomes
The focus of this is to correct defects *after* they occur.

### Communication skills and fostering relationships

Communication breakdown happens in some form during most projects, even with time and care devoted to it. Handling communication tactfully will help develop trust and others' confidence in your abilities. Some of the skills to do this are **negotiation, empathetic listening, and trust building**.

First, a key tactic for each of these skills is *asking questions*. Open-ended questions and active listening will help you understand the other person's current state and desired state., and what might help them get from the former to the latter.

*Practicing empathy* is important for building relationships too. You may have your own way of doing it, and that is perfectly fine. Just remember you should always:
- Show you understand their frustrations
- Address those frustrations
- Find a solution that benefits both of you

In order to find out what your customers want, you should ask them! *Feedback surveys* are one option for collecting information on your customers' wants and likes.

*User Acceptance Tests* are another way of getting feedback. You'll take the customer through a *critical user journey*, which is the sequence of steps a user follows to accomplish tasks in your product that you plan out yourself.

User acceptance test (UAT) agenda steps
1. Welcome users and thank them for participating
2. Present your product to them
3. Start UAT test cases
4. Walk users through a demonstration
5. Identify edge cases
	These typically pertain to software projects and deal with extreme minimums and maximums of parameters.
6. Recap findings, identify issues, and prioritize which issues should be addressed first

When collecting feedback, it's good to keep accessibility in mind...
- Offer to provide accommodations before *and* during the survey/collection period
- Examine the space with an accessibility lens
- Check that the systems you are using are fully accessible
- Make accessibility part of the conversation from the beginning

In a project management role, being able to empathize and understand how different people n the world will interact with your product is really important.

### Continuous improvement and process improvement

Continuous improvement begins with recognition, specifically of when processes need to be created, eliminated, or improved.

Data driven improvement
	Operating by the framework of DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, control), you can use the data you collect to drive changes and make more reliable improvements.

Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA)
	A more streamlined four step process focusing on identifying the problem, applying a fix, assessing the results, and fine-tuning the final fix so that it fits the project moving forward as well. 

A program manager supervises a group of projects and focuses on long-term business objectives. A portfolio manager supervises company-wide changes while managing both projects and programs.

**Retrospectives** can happen after major milestones, but typically are reserved for the end of the project. The purpose of retrospectives:
- Encourage team building
- Facilitate improved collaboration
- Promote positive changes

In short, the emphasis is on continuous improvement and change instead of recycling bad habits.

You want team members to feel comfortable sharing their feedback. People don't want to participate in retrospectives if they feel like their feedback won't be fully considered. Some other things to consider are:
- Maintain a positive tone
- Avoid assigning blame
- What went well, what could be improved, and where you got lucky

A common way to structure retrospectives is:
- Project summary
- Key accomplishments
- Lessons learned
- Action items
- Future considerations
- Resources

This is a great way not only to reflect on everything that happened throughout the project, but also make procedural changes and plan ahead for future projects.
