The hallmark of great leadership is not only developing a good plan and being responsive and proactive, but also inspiring their teammates and getting them to work well together.

But first... what exactly is a "team?"
	A group of people who plan, solve problems, make decisions, and review progress in service of a specific project or objective

Not to be confused with a "work group":
	People in an organization who work towards a common goal. Work groups are more likely to be coordinated, controlled, or assigned by a single person or entity.

Teamwork
	An effective, collaborative way of working in which each person is committed to heading towards a shared goal

### Effective and Ethical Leadership

Five factors that impact team effectiveness:
1. Psychological safety
	An individual's perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk. This involves taking risks around teammates, seeking differing opinions, and resolving interpersonal conflicts when they arise. Google team: "Be direct *and* kind."
2. Dependability
	Team members are reliable, complete their work on time, and meet expectations.
3. Structure and clarity
	An individual's understanding of expectations, knowledge of how to meet those expectations, and the consequences of their performance.
4. Meaning
	Finding a sense of purpose either in the work itself or the results of that work
5. Impact
	The belief that the results of one's work matter and create change

Effective team leaders
- create systems that turn chaos into order
- communicate and listen
- promote trust and psychological safety
- demonstrate empathy and create motivation
- delegate responsibility and prioritize
- celebrate team success

Sometimes you need to prioritize the needs of your team over the wants of your stakeholders- this is called **air cover**. It refers to situations where you provide support and protection to your team from out-of-scope requests or criticism from leadership. This obviously comes with some risk, so make sure you are prepared.
There may be cases where you'll want to spare your team the stress of unreasonable requests so that they can focus on their work. You can consult with just a few team members you trust to brainstorm ways to address the situation.

Bruce Tuckman's stages of team development
- Forming
	Team gets to know one another, and the PM clarifies goals, roles, and context for the project
- Storming
	Conflict and frustration emerges, and the PM handles conflict resolution and helps lead the team to better function as a unit
- Norming
	Conflicts are mostly resolved and the team is functioning, while the PM codifies the team norms (and reinforces them when needed) and makes sure everyone on the team is aware of them
- Performing
	The team works together seamlessly, while the PM focuses on delegating, motivating, and providing feedback to maintain momentum
- Adjourning
	Project wraps up, team disbands and celebrates final milestone success. The PM makes sure each team member knows what's next for them.

*Ethical leadership* promotes and values honesty, justice, respect, community, and integrity.
You can promote this by defining and aligning values with your team, and demonstrating how adhering to those values benefits the mission of the organization.

Framework for ethical decision making
- Recognize an ethical issue
- Get the facts
- Evaluate alternative actions
- Make a decision and test it
- Act and reflect on the outcome

### Influencing

As a project manager, you want to be able to influence your teammates go perform their best and make sure 

Steps for effective influencing:
1. Establish credibility - this is dependent on expertise and relationships
2. Frame for common ground - make the case for how your idea can benefit your audience
3. Provide evidence - make your case through numbers and strong storytelling
4. Connect emotionally - demonstrate that you have shared goals and values

Common mistakes when trying to influence others:
- Approaching the audience aggressively
- Resisting compromise
- Failing to establish credibility, common ground, or emotional connection
- Assume an agreement can be worked out though a single conversation

Approach isn't the only factor in influence. The other major ones are organizational and personal.
Organizational sources of power:
- Role
- Information (level of access and control)
- Network
- Reputation

Personal sources of power:
- Knowledge
- Expressiveness
- History (between you and another person)
- Character

These can be thought of as your "superpowers." Pay attention to your own sources of power and try to identify which is your super power!
