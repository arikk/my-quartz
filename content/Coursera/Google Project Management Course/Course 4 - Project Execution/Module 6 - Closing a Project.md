Closing a project means
- Assuring all work is done
- Agreed upon project management process are executed
- Stakeholders formally recognize and agree that the project is done

If some tasks or deliverables cannot be completed, you may end up with a *never-ending project*.

On the other hand, if you have inadequate handoff or transition on the project's deliverables, you get an *abandoned project*.

You may want to consider whether smaller closing processes for each milestone may be more fitting for your project, or whether it would be better to have a single large one at the end.

Steps to conducting a closing process after each phase/milestone:
- Refer back to prior documentation
	- Statement of work
	- Request for Proposal
	- Risk register
	- RACI chart
- Put together closing documentation
- Conduct administrative closure of the procurement process
- Make sure all stakeholders are aware of the phase/project's closure
- Execute necessary follow-up work

For conducting the closing process at the end:
- Provide necessary training, tools, documentation, and capability to use your project
- Ensure that the project has satisfied its goals and desired outcomes
- Document acceptance from all stakeholders
- Review all contracts and documentation
- Conduct a formal retrospective
- Disband and thank the project team

Impact reporting
	A presentation given at the end of a project for key stakeholders to demonstrate how the project went and its success

Retrospectives encourage team building, facilitate improved collaboration, and promote positive changes.

Project Closeout Report
 - Serves as a blueprint to document what the team did and how, and what they delivered
 - Provides and evaluation of the quality of work
 - Evaluates a project's performance with respect to budget and schedule
