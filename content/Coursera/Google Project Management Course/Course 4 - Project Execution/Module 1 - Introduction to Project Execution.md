Execution means carrying out all of the things previously covered! That is...
- How to actually respond to risks
- How to measure and track a project's progress
- How to use continuous improvement and quality management techniques
- How to use and analyze data to inform your own decision-making
- Team management and the fundamentals of influencing
- Effectively lead your team to the finish line
- Tools for effective team communication
- Organizing and facilitating meetings
- Closing a project

### Tracking and measuring progress

Aside from obviously making sure the project is on track for completion and success, tracking is also important for transparency and risk management.

Common things to track:
- Schedule
- Status of action items, key tasks and activities
- Progress towards milestones
- Costs
- Key decisions, changes, dependencies, and risks to the project

The **Gantt chart**, measuring tasks against time over the course of the project, is useful for:
- Visualizing the project timeline and helping the team stay on schedule
- Projects with many items like dependencies, milestones, tasks or activities
- Larger project teams with many people to manage
The visual similarity of a Gantt chart to a waterfall is another reason why the waterfall methodology is named so. ;)

Using a formal **Roadmap** is useful for:
- High-level tracking of large milestones
- Illustrating how a project should evolve over time to the team and key stakeholders
The roadmap outlines the project goals and the steps that will be taken to achieve them. It also has a **high-level overview**, which concisely states the objectives and priorities for your project. This is followed by a table that maps out the process in greater detail, listing milestones across timeframes like quarters or phases.

A **Burndown chart** measures time against the amount of work done and amount of work remaining. (Like a fuse to an explosive!) This is useful for:
- Projects that require a granular break-down of the tasks
- Projects where finishing on time is the top priority
This gets mapped to a graph to form a negative slope: x = remaining time, y = remaining work. There is typically a dotted line representing the team's expected progress and a solid line representing the actual progress.

In summary...
- Gantt chart handles a mass of tasks and multiple dependencies
- Roadmaps communicate milestones to large teams, best for getting a big-picture view
- Burndown chart is ideal when time-sensitivity is the focus

Choose your tracking method based on what criteria is important for your project. Mixing and using more than one over the course of the project is also an option!

Zooming out from the tasks and pausing to view the project as a whole can help to come up with some new ideas!

Project status reports are handy for summarizing the current progress of a project. They generally consist of:
- Project name - should communicate the overall goal of the project
- Date
- Summary
- Status
- Milestones and tasks - includes key accomplishments as well as upcoming milestones
- Issues

Use ROAM categories (resolved, owned, accepted, mitigated) to organize the issues you encounter.

Types of changes:
- New or changing dependencies
- Changing priorities
- Capacity and people
- Limitations on budget resources
- Scope creep
- Force majeure (unforeseeable major crisis, ex. worker's strike, pandemic)

These changes are measured against the triple constraint: budget, scope, and time.

Dependency management means... managing dependencies in order to make sure the project is completed successfully, within the budget, and on time.
The four steps you can take are:
- Proper identification
- Recording dependencies - use a risk register
- Continuous monitoring and control
- Efficient communication

If your dependencies are met on time, your team is less likely to fall behind schedule. And if you tightly manage your scope, you are less likely to encounter changes to your budget or timeline.

[[Risk exposure]]
	A way of measuring the potential future loss due to a specific activity or event.
	This uses the probability-impact matrix.

### Problem solving

**Escalation**- enlisting the help of higher level project leadership or management for an issue- is one of the ways of dealing with an obstacle. It should be used often and encouraged; communication is good!
- Acts as a form of checks and balances
- Generates speedy decision making
- Reduces frustrations
- Encourages participation

Escalations should be used at the first sign of a **critical problem** in a project.
Critical problems
- Cause a delay on a major milestone
- Cause budget overruns
- Can result in the loss of a customer
- Push back the estimated project completion date

Effective escalation
- Maintain a friendly tone
- State your connection to the project
- Explain the problem
- Explain the consequence
- Make a request
Be sure to put some kind of required action in the subject of the email/message!

Trench war
	In the context of project management, it is a disagreement between two parties that refuse to give or compromise.
Sometimes you get a **bad compromise**, when two parties settle on a solution but the product still suffers. That's why it's important to get a satisfactory resolution and outcome for the disagreement and product respectively.

Changes obviously need to be communicated, but how and with who is contextual. If you are informing just one or a few team members, usually an email will suffice.
If a big change impacts multiple people and affects the triple constraint, you will want to have a team meeting. 

Sometimes it's beneficial to take a time-out, get a little distance from the project, then reassess the situation and adjust the plan. It takes up time, but can be very worthwhile when things get complicated or frustrating.

Retrospective
	A meeting focused on identifying the contributing causes of an incident or pattern of incidents *without blaming any individual*.
