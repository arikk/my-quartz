## Understanding project resource needs

Refresher... Typical resources are:
- Budget
- People
- Materials

It's important to figure out the project's resources before it gets started! It's essential for planning and making sure your team members have what they need to get their work done, which is one of the main duties of project management.

Budget (estimate of how much money is needed)
	Hidden costs, like taxes?
People (who help execute the tasks of the project)
	You, the project manager, are a resource!
	Includes people outside the company who have certain skills or can complete some tasks your team does not/cannot.
Materials
	Items and... materials. Includes non-physical things like programs/applications.

These resources are *interdependent*. 

## Developing documentation for project kickoff

As demonstrated thus far, a major part of project management is **guiding decision making**.

Documentation helps keep everyone on the same page and enables them to focus on their tasks instead of the litany of details about the project. Also helpful for team members that get added on midway through! Also helps you reflect and learn from your experiences.

Project proposal
	Document persuading a stakeholder to begin a project, showing that the benefits of the project outweigh the costs. (Cost benefit analysis)
		- Value created
		- Money saved
		- Time invested
	May not be the project manager's responsibility!
	Typically only necessary at the start of a project.
	It's important to make sure you and your stakeholders agree on the project value!

Project charter
	Formal document clearly defining the project and outlining the details necessary to reach its goals.
	Approval is important for making sure a project matches the needs of an organization.
	Used throughout all stages of a project, and can evolve as the project progresses.
	Can be tailored to specific audiences and/or stakeholders.

Common criteria in project charters:
- intro/project summary
- goals/objectives
- business cases/benefits and costs
- project team
- scope
- success criteria
- major requirements, key deliverables, OKRs
- budget
- schedule/timeline or milestones
- constraints and assumptions
- risks
- approvals

For more complex projects, you may include links to additional analysis, studies, or documents.

The more detailed the project charter is, the easier it will be to convert it into an effective project plan.

## Evaluating tools to meet project needs

Project management tools help you track deadlines, provides visibility to others, manage a budget, create helpful diagrams, manage contracts...

The complexity of the tool should be appropriate for the size and scope of the project.

Make sure beforehand that implementing a new tool is worthwhile. Show the benefits as clearly as you can. By demonstrating your understanding of the tool and your competency with it, you will help build trust and make your team more comfortable with the change.

Important things to consider:
- discuss the tool early and often, if possible. Don't blindside your team!
- Ask for feedback from stakeholders; they may have some expertise.
- Involve key stakeholders in demonstrations as you get closer to making the final decision on the tool.
- Ensure the tool is fully functional <u>before</u> introducing it.
- Set up training for the tool as needed <u>before</u> asking your team to use it.

A lot of the tools listed sound like they serve very similar purposes, but I'm sure they each have their own nuances that make them more appropriate for certain projects over others. Pretty unclear from an introductory view though.
