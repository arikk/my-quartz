This feels a little dumb.

Project managers add value to their teams! Wow!
**Prioritization**: they help their team break down large tasks into smaller steps

Sometimes I don't feel like I'm good at this step, but the house painting example sounds like one I would be very good at. I'd consider all the things the lecturer mentioned, because I'm obsessive about making sure anything permanent is done properly.

**Delegation** is utilizing people and their strengths for the jobs they are the best fit for.
**Communication** and checking in regularly and staying in contact is key! Keep people informed.

JuAnne's experience sounds like something I would enjoy.

Customers can be internal and external.
Internal: stakeholders like management, team members, resource managers, organizational department
External: clients, contractors, suppliers, consumers

Goals centered around the customer. The team is the project's greatest asset. Fostering relationships through communication makes people feel valued. Managing the project also involves clearly communicating everyone's roles and their impact. Manage quality by mitigating risks as they change and new ones come up. ==Ask for input and suggestions from your team about how to build towards your goal; this will let them use their voice and help foster an environment of accountability and responsibility, and likely make the team feel closer.==
