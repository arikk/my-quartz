Asking about the company’s culture at an interview is a great way to get more info about the company and shows you understand how big of an impact it can have on a project.\nAsk questions.

People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to perform better and drive for success.\nProcesses\nA company’s culture almost always reflects on the way it works, internally and externally, and in turn the way the company does business inside and outside affects the culture.

There is always a tradeoff.\nDocument everything beforehand and make sure everyone (team and stakeholders) is in agreement on the scope before the start of the project.\nLaunching and Landing\nproperly delivering the project and tracking the results after the product has been in use\nDon’t launch and forget! It is relieving to hand your project over to the client and celebrate completion, but ensuring the project’s success means you need to see if it meets the success criteria you laid out beforehand, or is on track to meet them.\nBaking a cake isn&#039;t enough to tell whether you did a good job- someone has to taste it and confirm.\nTo determine a project’s success criteria…\n\nIdentify measurable aspects of your project\nGet clarity from stakeholders on project requirements and expectations (key!)\nDocument and share all the info so that the team and stakeholders can refer to it later.\n\nThe metric(s) you choose must be as closely aligned to the project goal as possible. Satisfaction, adoption, and engagement are some ways of measuring success.\nIt&#039;s smart to measure success while the project/product is in progress. This can be done by having your team complete checklists for progress meetings, or hold live feedback sessions with users/customers.\nMethods for measuring criteria for success should include how, when (how often), and who. Defining success criteria should create greater alignment in the team and give everyone better visibility of how to achieve success.

The big items that indicate progress are your milestones. Smaller items that your stakeholders wouldn’t want to review are tasks.\nTop-down scheduling: first outlining milestones and then defining the tasks that will be required to reach them\nBottom-up scheduling: looking at all the individual tasks required to reach the goal and grouping them into manageable chunks as milestones\nDon’t set too many milestones- the number needed will depend on the project.\nDon’t mistake tasks for milestones; milestones represent moments in time, like mini-goals.\nDon’t list tasks and milestones separately.

Assigning tasks helps create a sense of personal responsibility and ownership for the team. This helps keep them motivated and invested! (Also helps build trust and rapport)\nStarting the Planning phase\n\nGantt chart? Sounds like a schedule. Helps outline and clarify task timelines and dependencies.\nEstimate the budget, and include a buffer for overages. They are always overages.\nCreate a Statement of Work (SoW) for any vendors and yourself\na legal document that defines what you need from the vendor and sets clear expectations.\nCreate a risk management plan, anticipating sick days, staffing shortages, shipping delays, etc.\nCreate a communication plan to track senders and recipients, communication goals, key dates, and more. It’s important for information to travel timely and smoothly, so plan this beforehand!\n\nReference\ncoursera.org"},"Coursera/Google-Project-Management-Course/Course-3/Module-2---Building-a-Project-Plan":{"slug":"Coursera/Google-Project-Management-Course/Course-3/Module-2---Building-a-Project-Plan","filePath":"Coursera/Google Project Management Course/Course 3/Module 2 - Building a Project Plan.md","title":"Module 2 - Building a Project Plan","links":[],"tags":["project_management","coursera"],"content":"2025-07-15 18:43\nGetting started with a project plan\nMost project plans are made up of five elements:\n\nTasks\nMilestones\nPeople\nDocumentation\nTime\n\nScope and goals - Work Breakdown Structure - Management plans - Budget\nThese are connected!\nUsing estimation to set project timelines\n(Management plans are plans on how to handle communication, risk, and any changes that will arise, anything that helps keep the project on track.)\nEffort vs. time estimation: Painting a wall takes 3 hours of work (effort) and 24 hours to dry (time)\nThis is useful for planning multitasking/parallel tasks.\nYour teammates will have the most realistic estimates of how long their tasks will take. Who knew!\nTime buffers are nice, but should be used sparingly for tasks within the teams control. It may be easier to set a project buffer at the end of the project instead of many smaller task buffers along the way.\nDon’t get caught up in the optimism fallacy; Murphy’s Law may be a bit extreme, but something is guaranteed to go differently than your plan. Expect the unexpected.\nCapacity planning refers to the allocation of people’s time and energy, and other resources to project tasks.\n(Earlier people counted as resources, but the mini quiz separates them two different things)\nCapacity planning involves these areas of focus:\n\nIdentifying parallel tasks vs. sequential tasks and maximizing your team’s use of time. Sequential tasks help you see what you need to prioritize.\nDetermine which tasks have a fixed start date\nDetermine earliest start dates for all other tasks\nIdentify if a task has float (or slack)\nThe amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule and threatens the outcome\nTasks on the critical path will have no float.\n\nDeciding how a teammate should prioritize their time and make the most of their capacity can be done by determining the critical path:\nA list of project milestones and their mandatory tasks required to meet the project goal on schedule. It is the bare minimum number of tasks and milestones needed to reach your goal.\nTo determine the your critical path,\n\nCapture all tasks\nSet dependencies\nCreate a network diagram, sequencing tasks based on dependencies and parallels. Non-essential tasks are not part of the critical path.\nMake time estimates for essential and non-essential tasks using capacity planning. Essential tasks will have zero float, while non-essential ones will have some float.\nThe essential tasks and their required time will be your critical path!\n\nYou can also calculate the critical path two ways:\n\nForward pass - adding the duration of each task on the critical path from start to finish. Good for simplicity. Potential for expansion?\nBackwards pass - start at the end goal and work backwards through the required tasks. Helps with hard deadlines by focusing on which tasks are really critical. Some tasks may be completed later or cut altogether.\n\nSoft skills are personal characteristics that help you work effectively with others. They will be helpful for gathering accurate estimates from your teammates.\nSome common ones to apply:\n\nAsking the right questions - open ended and follow ups!\nNegotiating effectively - ask probing questions and follow ups to get a feel for their flexibility and workload\nPracticing empathy - ask about their workload, inside and outside the project, as well as any other things that may demand their time and focus, including rest and time off.\n\nAngel sounds like a great project manager :)\nUtilizing tools to build a project plan\nThe anchor of a clear project plan is a clear schedule, containing all tasks, their owners, and their deadlines.\nGantt chart - a horizontal bar chart that maps a project schedule.\nCommon left columns: task title, task owner, start date, due date, duration, % completed. The rows below will list each task. Great place to plug in your work breakdown structure.\nRight columns will be for days and weeks estimated to complete the project from start to finish. The rows below this will show bars/markers showing dates when each task will take place.\nMay not work for all projects!\nKanban board - uses cards to track and visualize the progress of your tasks, typically moving tasks between columns like “to do,” “in progress,” “testing,” and “done.” This tool is useful for an Agile project approach.\nrefresher - Agile is an iterative development process where results are tested along the way, incorporating customer feedback.\nKanban boards help by\n- giving a quick visual understanding of work details and critical task info\n- facilitating hand-offs between stakeholders and team members\n- capturing metrics and improving workflows\nCards have:\n- titles/ID numbers for one task\n- who is assigned to the task\n- description of work\n- estimation of effort\n- start date, finish date\n- blocked days where it cannot be worked on\nAsana and Trello both have good Kanban plugins.\nOr you could just have a large document containing tables, lists, and links to other planning documents. It’s up to you to decide how to keep everyone on the same page as long as you include all of the critical project elements in one place.\nTask names (or ID numbers if there are a lot) to make communication clear\nTask durations to get clear time estimates and schedule\nStart and finish dates on tasks to measure progress\nWho is responsible for each task\nBest practices for project planning:\n\nCarefully review deliverables, milestones, and tasks\nGive yourself time to plan\nRecognize and plan for the inevitable; things will go wrong, but it’s okay!\nStay curious - ask your teammates lots of questions about their work\nChampion your plan\nCan your teammates use the tool you used to build the plan?\nIs the information clear enough for your stakeholders?\nWill using this plan as a singular source of truth save your team and stakeholders time and energy when they need to find information on the project?\nIf the answer to each of these is “yes,” then stand by your plan and advocate for its benefits.\n\nReference\ncoursera.org, the ol’ noggin"},"Coursera/Google-Project-Management-Course/index":{"slug":"Coursera/Google-Project-Management-Course/index","filePath":"Coursera/Google Project Management Course/index.md","title":"Google Project Management Course","links":["Coursera/Google-Project-Management-Course/Course-1/Module-2---Core-Skills"],"tags":[],"content":"lorem ipsum\nModule 2 - Core Skills"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"My Site","links":["Coursera/Google-Project-Management-Course/Course-1/Module-1---Intro-to-Project-Management"],"tags":[],"content":"2025-06-19 12:35\nModule 1 - Intro to Project Management\nReference"}}
